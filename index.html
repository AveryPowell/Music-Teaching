        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I’m Avery, and I’m passionate about helping people of all ages and skill levels discover the joy of music. My journey as a music educator began at Lane Community College, where I tutored music theory and received a special award for exceptional scholarship in the field. From there, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in music from the University of Oregon, developing an extensive knowledge of Western classical music.

Beyond the classroom, I’ve been playing in bands for over 10 years, honing my skills as a guitarist, vocalist, and keyboardist. This diverse experience has given me a broad understanding of music that spans classical traditions and modern performance practices.

I’ve had the privilege of teaching students ranging in age from 6 to 60, each with unique goals—whether it’s personal enrichment, live performance, recording arts, or professional musicianship. My adaptable teaching style ensures that lessons are tailored to fit your reasons for learning.

I specialize in guitar and piano, with a focus on improvisation and theory, offering a holistic approach to music education. Whether you want to dive deep into technique, explore creative expression, or build confidence as a performer, I’m here to guide you every step of the way.

Lessons are available both in-person and online, providing flexibility to meet your needs. In-person sessions take place in the comfort of your own home, creating a relaxed and familiar environment for learning..</p>
